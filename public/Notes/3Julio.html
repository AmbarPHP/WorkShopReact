===Authentication flows===

Authentication flows
Most apps require that a user authenticate in some way to have access to data associated 
with a user or other private content. 

Typically the flow will look like this:

+The user opens the app.
+The app loads some authentication state from persistent storage (for example, AsyncStorage).
+When the state has loaded, the user is presented with either authentication screens or the main app, 
depending on whether valid authentication state was loaded.
+When the user signs out, we clear the authentication state and send them back to authentication screens.
Note: We say "authentication screens" because usually there is more than one. You may have a main screen 
with a username and password field, another for "forgot password", and another set for sign up.

#What we need
This is the behavior that we want from the authentication flow:
 when users sign in, we want to throw away the state of the authentication flow and unmount all of the screens 
 related to authentication, and when we press the hardware back button we expect to not be able to go back to the authentication flow.

#How it will work
We can define different screens based on some condition. 
For example, if the user is signed in, we can define Home, Profile, Settings etc. 
If the user is not signed in, we can define SignIn and SignUp screens.
