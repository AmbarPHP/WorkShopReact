==Array vs Objects ==

Nobody seems to be explaining the difference between an array and an object.

[] is declaring an array.

{} is declaring an object.

An array has all the features of an object with additional features (you can think of an array like a sub-class of an object) 
where additional methods and capabilities are added in the Array sub-class.
 In fact, typeof [] === "object" to further show you that an array is an object.

 The additional features consist of a magic .length property that keeps track of the number of items in the array and a whole 
 slew of methods for operating on the array such as .push(), .pop(), .slice(), .splice(), etc... You can see a list of array methods here.


 An object gives you the ability to associate a property name with a value as in:

 var x = {};
x.foo = 3;
x["whatever"] = 10;
console.log(x.foo);      // shows 3
console.log(x.whatever); // shows 10

An array is an object so it has all the same capabilities of an object plus a bunch of additional features for managing an ordered, 
sequential list of numbered indexes starting from 0 and going up to some length. Arrays are typically used for an ordered list of items 
that are accessed by numerical index. And, because the array is ordered, there are lots of useful features to manage 
the order of the list .sort() or to add or remove things from the list.
